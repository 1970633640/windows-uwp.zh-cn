<a id="ID4EQ"></a>

  
 
MultiplayerSession JSON 对象具有以下规范。
 
| 成员| 类型| 说明| 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| 常量| object| 会话模板，以生成会话常量与合并的只读的设置。 | 
| 属性 | object | 合并到的会话属性更改。| 
| members.me | object| 常量和很多工作的属性，例如其顶级对应项。 任何 PUT 方法需要用户是会话的成员，并添加用户，如有必要。 "我"指定为 null，如果是从会话中删除发出请求的成员。 | 
| 成员 | object| 表示用户添加到会话中，从零开始的索引键控其他对象。 在请求中的成员数开始时始终具有 0，即使会话已包含成员。 成员将添加到会话中请求中出现的顺序。 成员属性只能由用户属于其设置。 | 
| 服务器 | object| 关联的服务器参与者的设置的值，该值指示更新和添加到会话。 服务器指定为 null，如果是从会话中删除该服务器条目。 |
